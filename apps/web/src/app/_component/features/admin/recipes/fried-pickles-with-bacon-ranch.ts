Unlike foods like shrimp and chicken that can get woefully dried out when improperly fried, pickles are pretty much impossible to desiccate. A fragile coating that falls off during frying or on the way to your mouth is a much bigger concern with pickles, since their vinegary brine is too thin to form a good foundation for a breaded coating. Much better is viscous buttermilk, which coats and clings to the pickle slices and gives the dry ingredients something to really cling onto and soak into. The key, though, is to pat the pickle slices dry before dipping in the buttermilk, otherwise the pickle brine will thin the buttermilk, reducing its viscosity and undermining its ability to form a strong coating that will stay put.
