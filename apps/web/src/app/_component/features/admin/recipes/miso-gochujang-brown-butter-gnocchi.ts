# Lemony Garlicky Miso Gochujang Brown Butter Gnocchi

This gnocchi dish leans on a savory-sour-spicy emulsion of miso, gochujang, lemon juice, and deeply golden brown butter, finished with fried garlic and herbs.

== Sauce Base  
- [50 g] Unsalted butter  
- [4 cloves] Garlic *(sliced thin)* !!  
- [15 g] White miso paste  
- [10 g] Gochujang  
- [1 tablespoon] Lemon juice *(fresh)* 
- [2 tablespoons] Pasta water *(reserved)*

1. In a skillet over medium heat, melt butter and cook, stirring frequently, until solids begin to brown and smell nutty, about 3–5 minutes.  
2. Add sliced garlic and reduce heat to low. Stir until golden and crisp but not burnt. Remove garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside.  
3. Off heat, whisk miso and gochujang into brown butter until smooth. Stir in lemon juice, zest, and pasta water to form a glossy emulsion.  

== Gnocchi  
- [350 g] Potato gnocchi!!  
- [1 tsp] salt 
- [2 tablespoons] Neutral oil

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi until they float to the surface, about 2–3 minutes.  
2. Optional: Drain gnocchi and sear in neutral oil over medium-high heat until golden and crispy on one or both sides.  
3. Add gnocchi to the pan with sauce base. Toss to coat evenly and rewarm gently over low heat.  

== Garnish  
- [1 handful] Fresh parsley or chives *(chopped)* !!  
- [1 tablespoon] Fried garlic *(from earlier)*  
- [1/8 cup] Parmigiano-Reggiano

1. Plate the sauced gnocchi. Top with fried garlic, herbs, and cheese or nutritional yeast, if using.  
2. Serve immediately, with extra lemon on the side if desired.
